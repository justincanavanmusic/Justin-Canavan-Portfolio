# Justin-Canavan-Portfolio

This is Justin Canavan's Portfolio of work. 
The motivation to make this portfolio was so that I could have all of my work presented in a sleek one page site. This site would ideally allow potential employers to see the type of employee I could potentially be.
In the process I focused a lot on CSS Styling, box positioning, flexbox, media queries, html, nav links, and much more.
